              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/bionics">Bionics</a> is technology that now and in the future will assist those who lose certain basic human abilities
              ,such as walking or vision. This technology uses biology and applies it to engineering and attempts to mimic and can seek to enhance and maintain human body parts
              and organs.

              The technology is trying ot evolve and ecompass even more advanced deficiencies such as loss of vision or hearing according to <a target="_blank" href="https://aabme.asme.org/posts/bionics-a-step-into-the-future"> AABME </a>
              (Alliance of Advanced BioMedical Engineering). However the main focus of this will be covering the topic of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/bionic-limbs">Bionic Limbs.</a>

              Bionic limbs are going to be an extremely important technology going forward, and will help those who have lost limbs and grant them the ability to be more
              self-sufficent. The most common reason for the loss of limbs (in the US) according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amputee-coalition.org/resources/limb-loss-statistics/">Amputee Coalition</a>
              is cardiovascular disease. Whatever the reason for the loss of a limb, bionics will still play a role in helping people getting back into a normal lifestyle. There is also
              a lot of work being done on attempting to restore the sensation of touch to these limbs. A normal robotoic prosthetic will not have any sort of genuine touch. There are
              researchers however who are working on this and have released a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00120/full">research article</a> covering a lot of their work.

              The last very interestning point to us is the ability to further augment the human bodies capabilities. This might be far into the future, but it will be very interestning
              to see enhanced human capabilities, such as choosing to replace your arm with a bionic one instead. For now however <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/exoskeleton-anatomy">Exoskeletons</a>
              are the closes thing we have. Exoskeletons does not need the limb to be removed to work, and usually envelopes the already existing limbs. It can give humans more
              strength, and also asisting in strainous work such as in factories or other places where lifting heavy objects is a normal everyday endavour.
