        <h2 id="benefits">Benefits of electronic prosthetics & bionics</h2>
        <p>
          Prosthetics and bionics are technologies that assist those who lose 
          certain motor or sensory functions, such as walking. This technology 
          uses biology and applies it to engineering, attempting to mimic, 
          enhance or maintain human body parts and organs. They can encompass 
          advanced deficiencies such as loss of vision or hearing 
          (<a target="_blank" href="https://aabme.asme.org/posts/bionics-a-step-into-the-future">Alliance of Advanced Biomedical Engineering, 2017</a>). 
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe electronic prosthetics are important since they help those 
          who have lost limbs and will grant them the ability to be more self-sufficient. 
          We think they aid in maintaining physical and cognitive function. 
          In the future, we believe electronic prosthetics will be capable of relaying 
          sensory information, since there are already efforts 
          attempting to restore the sensation of touch to limbs 
          (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00120/full">Schofield et al., 2020</a>). 
          We believe they benefit the user by facilitating movement in public spaces, 
          and thus makes it more manageable for those who need them to participate in society. 
          Electronic prosthetics improves stability, which we believe prevents accidents and 
          resulting injuries. Finally, we believe these technologies contribute towards 
          reducing social stigma against marginalized groups such as people with 
          disabilities or neurodevelopmental disorders. It’s a form of accessible 
          design that improves equity, since it recognizes the different circumstances 
          of each person and provides them with the opportunities and resources needed to reach an equal outcome.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ethics">Ethics of human body augmentation</h2>
        <p>
          We find the ability to further augment the human body capabilities intriguing, 
          for instance limb augmentation out of choice rather than necessity. 
          Exoskeletons usually envelop already existing limbs, and thus do not require limb removal. 
          We believe they can give humans more strength, and assist in strenuous work and manual 
          labour such as lifting heavy objects in a warehouse or workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the development of such technologies, we must consider their major ethical risks. 
          We don’t want to see a world where enhancements are only available to the people who can 
          afford them. The infancy of human body augmentation technology means that it is expensive to 
          develop, and we believe the publicity of being the first innovators attracts billionaires who 
          have the means to do so. We must ensure that the technology is being developed by an inclusive 
          and diverse team, whose focus is societal improvement and accessibility, 
          both financially and geographically. Include someone trained in philosophy and ethics on staff. 
          We are also in favour of governmental regulation and oversight in genetic engineering in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe other important principles during development are reversibility, reusability and adaptability. 
          We must be careful not to create anything that cannot be reversed, if we discover 
          that it has unintended consequences, and the technologies aren't sustainable if they 
          are limited to the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the technology gets more refined and ubiquitous, it can be argued that 
          not applying it is unethical, since it prevents unnecessary motor and sensory obstacles. 
          Not making it available would deny people the independence and self-sufficiency it provides. 
          But even minor enhancements could create an even wider gap between new social classes, 
          such as those who have them and those who don’t, and could lead to new kinds of exploitation
