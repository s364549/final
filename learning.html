      <h2>Transition</h2>
      <p>
        Student one went right from upper-secondary school to university and 
        experienced a change in the expected degree of independent work. 
        He had previously dabbled with JavaScript, C and HTML, so this semester 
        served as a useful refresher with regards to coding and programming. 
        This semester has nonetheless provided a useful foundation and introduction 
        to object-oriented programming.
      </p>

        Student two pursued a professional degree in psychology at the University of Oslo, 
        but decided to abandon it and instead enter the workforce. For five years he 
        worked in retail as a service technician of consumer electronics, but honestly 
        didn’t feel like the position provided enough challenges. He also realized the 
        limited career opportunities in the sector, and decided to pursue the field of 
        technology. In the year leading up to the beginning of this first semester, 
        he enrolled in CS50, Harvard’s introductory computer science course, which 
        introduced many of the key concepts used in coding and programming. 
        He felt well prepared, though a bit nervous, to begin his journey at OsloMet.
      </p>

        Student three went right from taking subjects on his own to OsloMet, and was 
        therefore used to working independently. He experienced challenges with 
        allocating his time and spending that time working efficiently, but eventually 
        adjusted to student life. He had little previous coding experience, but found 
        learning the subjects of this semester to be easily manageable.

      <h2>Coding and programming</h2>
      <p>
        Learning to code and program has been quite enjoyable, because we all have a 
        deep-seated interest for technology in one way or another. We all had different 
        levels of coding experience, and due to the digitization of everything school 
        related, we could progress through each subject at our own pace. If we would 
        like, the Canvas video player allows us to increase the playback speed of 
        pre-recorded lectures, which is especially useful when you’re already 
        familiar with the subject of the module.

        Fortunately, the foundation of HTML and CSS is not that difficult, 
        but we’ve faced challenges when creating  responsive layouts, and the 
        issues tend to appear unexpectedly. For instance, we had to adapt 
        to images scaling incorrectly. Sometimes, the text in our website’s 
        paragraph shrunk on smaller displays to a level of illegibility. 
        The paragraphs themselves would also narrow, and the resulting lines of 
        text would become impractically short. To reduce the necessity for 
        several size and scale relevant CSS rules, we’ve learned to use the 
        <code>clamp()</code> CSS function to set lower and upper limits.

        Learning GitHub this semester has been one of our most valuable experiences. 
        Using GitHub to work together on collaborative projects has presented its 
        own challenges. After developing code simultaneously we encountered 
        conflicts. We’ve had to remind ourselves to update our repositories 
        frequently. Alternatively, we could work on multiple branches, but 
        to prevent having to merge each branch afterwards and to minimize 
        divergence of our code, primarily modifying the main branch is a 
        trade-off we’re willing to make. Especially since the participants 
        in our group haven’t been able to meet in person as much as we’d like, 
        the user-friendly GitHub Desktop application has proven essential in 
        both our learning to code and exercising our coding skills.
